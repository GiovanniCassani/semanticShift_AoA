README

This repo contains code detailing the analyses performed for the CogSci paper 'Words with consistent diachronic usage patterns are learned earlier. A computational analysis using temporally aligned word embeddings'.

All the necessary datasets are provided in the folder 'data/', whereas the folder 'src/' contains Python code to read relevant resources to compute OLD20 for the target words as well as R code to run linear models and generate the plots included in the paper.
